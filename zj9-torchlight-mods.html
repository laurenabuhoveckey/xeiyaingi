I picked up Torchlight during the steam sale and i remember someone posting what mods to pick up. i cant find the comment that had all the info so does anyone have suggestions on what i should.  Первое упоминание об Уфе как о городе относится к 1574 году, потому в 2013 году уфимцы широко отпраздновали 439-летие города. Just got Torchlight from the Humble Indie Bundle, and before I start playing, I wanna build the best possible experience for my first playthrough. So, what mods would you recomend? Nothing pretaining to cheating, just gameplay tweeks and fixes, maybe some extra content. I can't even get blank landscapes to run without my game crashing. Never had this problem with Vista. My search through the forum proved fruitless, didn't know if anyone else knew about this, or something I could do. Thanks Mod Spotlight: Torchlight. The game gives you no such option. That is, until you install the GenderMod, which adds three more playable classes: Valkyrie, which is a female version of the Destroyer, Executioner, the male alternative to Vanquisher, or an Enchantress, female adept of the alchemical. I'm tired of Diablo effortlessly kicking my butt so I'm giving up on Diablo 2 for now and I'm thinking of doing another playthrough of Torchlight instead. I've won with all three classes and would like to try something new. What's out there worth an install? Thanks. Swordsman class. The Swordsman is a new playable class for Torchlight 2. He is a versatile warrior, specialized in physical damage. He starts the game with sword and shield. No mods were found matching the criteria specified.

Hello, I got torchlight native for linux in the Humble Bunble and I'm trying to install some mods. I extract them in "/home/users/.runicgames/Torchlight/Mods" but, no dice. When I start the game nothing happens. Am I missing something? Did any of you succeed? Thank. Best Torchlight 2 Mods You Can’t Play Without. Torchlight 2, one of the best dungeon crawling loot fests on PC, has a lively modding community, adding tons of new content and balancing the game. These mods range from minor, like a slight change to your UI, to enormous changes, like dozens of hours of new content. To the gamers out there versed. So how is the current state of the torchlight modding community? I downloaded a few when the game first came out, and they were alright; but they didn't have much substance. Is anything cool out now or is it still just half-assed new classes and reskins. SynergiesMOD is a modification for Torchlight II created by Synergies Team.

I recently purchased Torchlight during a sale at gog.com, and I want to use the respec mod that allows the purchase of respec potions at merchants in town. The instructions on the mod site say to unzip the file into a mod folder in the games program files, but the folder is not there. Is this because I have to make the folder myself, or because I bought it from somewhere other than steam. I'm dustin' off the ol' torchlight about a year later to play it again, and I'm curious: what does reddit think are the best mods? I have the potion stacking up to 200 mod, but thats it. Others? EDIT: Links so if i get a hook on the mods when i start the game i get them or i have to download it from another side? And a question to the torchlight mod synergies it dont work for multiplayer? i get everytime a crash if someone join me :( i play with torchlight essentials, TLE-2, variant class And i tried the fix for essentials and synergies but still https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/988/288/03a These games i cherish deeply and i can play for hours, these are games i consider QUALITY and what every game should strive for, these are games that if i had to pick 10 PC games for the rest of my life, i would pick these. ------ #1 Diablo Why? The original is such a delight, i love the sprites, the soundtrack, this game was dark souls before dark souls, i love the rougelike element. The feeling of hopelessness. Typical. Hi! I am a complete stranger to the game. I've played only a bit of PoE and a bit of Diablo 3 and generally I do not like Diablo styled ARPGs. I recently watched a presentation from Brevik about diablo 1 and got interested to try the series. I went over to a friends house that's obsessed and tried Diablo 1. I didn't enjoy it. It felt very very clunky. I've heard everyone say that even though Diablo 2 is an amazing ARPG it is really not so "New-Player" friendly due to simillar problems So I currently have access to a Vita and a PC with an i3 4130, Intel hd4400 graphics, and 4gb ram. I obviously can't run Path of exile, grim dawn, or diablo 3 on this pc so I would like suggestions for similar games that I can actually run. Diablo 2 is my favorite game of all time but after a few weeks the nostalgia goes away and I need something a bit more modern. I'm not looking just for arpgs just any game that has a deep and rewarding progression system
