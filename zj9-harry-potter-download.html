Every time I find a promising fic and this shit comes up I feel like banging my head against the wall. I can understand and even want to read about Harry's family history, how the Potters gained their fortune (I know in canon its bc of those hair potions) or "family history" because I do think there's potential to be sought there. James was a rich pureblood who had one of the Hallows, it doesn't take much imagination to write up something interesting about the family.

I've read a lot of fanfics, so it is getting harder and harder to find good ones. Could someone reccomend some for me? Thanks. Видео: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer′s Stone - 1 Кино. Full HP Audiobooks Free - download or streaming online. Read by Jim Dale and Stephen Fry Harry Potter Audiobooks. Written by J.K, Rowling. Looking for fics that make you say "man, the HP fandom truly has everything". Completely ridiculous or highly unusual premises welcome. Harry transfiguring Pokémon? Sure. Harry living as an elf because he thinks that the is one? Why not. Grindelwald trying to make up for WW2 by helping against Voldemort but constantly getting in trouble because his followers assume that he's conquering the world? Great! Harry getting saved by a superhero Zorro wizard who's only alive because of Harry's. ♫ Harry Potter OST ♫, спасибо обож мне предстоит 6 часть в скором времени, похоже придется запастись салфетками / начала смотреть в оригинальной озвучке и трогать за душу стало в несколько раз сильнее, хоть и не понимаю.

Everybody likes a good crossover fic, which fandoms do you think work best in crossover? Marvel? Game of Thrones? Lord of the Rings? Alternatively, what fandoms would you like to see more crossovers with? Which fandoms do you think are overdone. Any fics where Hermione is just not in it, or a minor miiiiiinor character. I am so sick of fanon Hermione I literally can not take it anymore. It doesn't have to be bashing, just where she is irrelevant. Any pairing het or slash is fine I just want a good Harry centric fic where it's not Hermione saving the day. Thanks. The in-progress fics I am currently following: All three of these are great, which is why I am following them! I didn't give away any plot points, but if you are super sensitive to the possibility of spoilers, then just read the summaries and not into "My favorite part." 1. The Phoenix Burns Brightest by AnyaYanko: Linkao3(The Phoenix Burns Brightest). My summary: When Harry is 4, Dumbledore realizes he is the only one who can raise Harry in a safe and loving environment. So he plucks. A fic where Hermione is essentially her canon self, with a Harry as talented as a teen Voldemort. Bonus points if there's a Luna that is just a weird girl from the death of her mother and her father being super eccentric. Double bonus points if Luna deals with her issues. Triple if there are no lordships. No slash preferably. Before anyone recommends 
Looking for stories where Harry can duel Tom to a standstill. Preferably no main pair slash. As in, if someone described it to you, you would say "Jesus Christ." linkffn(https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11636560/1/It-s-Always-The-Quiet-Ones) is a good example of what I mean. Edit: To anyone asking about the Gabrielle fic, I honestly can't remember what it was called and I'm glad that I don't. I'm confident it breaks the subreddit's rules. If you're genuinely curious, search through every smut request thread made in the last 2 months Looking for a really good long fic (200k+) to distract me from impending exams. Preferably complete but recently/regularly updated is also good. Preferablely Harry centric, and I like a good heart wrenching romance, mainly slash but well written non slash pairings are also great. Preferably not a rewrite of all the Hogwarts years with only minor changes, I've read a few too many of those recently. Thanks. Hey guys, I'm not entirely sure where to post this, but if any of you guys could suggest a better subreddit, I'd appreciate it. So I'm a die hard Harry Potter fan and actually somewhat enjoyed the 2nd Deathly Hallows game way back when I played it on the 360. I want to purchase this game on PC (Origin) but I literally cannot find this game anywhere. I saw a discussion on Steam dated in 2015 where people were saying you could get it on G2A for literally a few bucks. However now, I can't As a dedicated harmony reader I thought it's about time to read about harry with others. Looking for harry with either tonks or Luna with him still being friends with Hermione and ron but doesnt have those two paired together. Sorry but I cant stomach 'romione.' Please no Dumbledore bashing or lord potter nonsense. Any and all help is appreciated. 
Finals seasons is rolling around and I need some good Harry/Anyone fluff fics to counteract this stress. Preferably post war or crossover fics just focusing on character interaction. I've already reread Grow Young With Me and pretty much everything by dorothea greengrass so new ones would be preferred. Thanks in advance. It's basically Harry Potter being extremely done with the wizarding world's shit. He just goes through life in Hogwarts thinking 'God, this again?'. Not caring about the ministry and their corruption, The Muggle world and its problems, Dumbledore and his greater good, or Voldemort and his monologues and overdramatic speeches. amp#x200B; Edit: It would be also nice if the fic didn't have any pairing with Harry. Definitely not HarryxHermione or HarryxGinny. Are there any fanfics where Ron is depicted positively? In nearly everything I've read, he is 1) A non-character along the lines of Seamus and Dean 2) A punching bag, basically used for Harry to have a dramatic moment of yelling at someone in order to demonstrate the difference between CanonHarry and SuperHarry 3) An honest-to-god villain, dosing Harry with love potions to get him to marry Ginny or whatnot. He can't be UNIVERSALLY hated among fanfic writers No crossovers No female Harry. The low cost of a wand (7 galleons for Harry's) has been a noted flaw in canon. Assuming that Ollivander sells 50-60 wands based on Hogwarts class size for a year plus a few extras, he simply would not earn enough. Seven galleons may not even be enough to cover the cost of materials, let alone the cost of labor, time and expertise. And he has competition too. Fanon had usually solved this by raising the cost of wands, having the Ministry subsidise first wands or by having wandmakers sell other. Examples would be - a network of muggleborns supporting each other - something comparable for magical creatures - an organisation that practices advanced or forbidden magic - any kind of smaller magical societ, hidden within the normal magical world. </p>
